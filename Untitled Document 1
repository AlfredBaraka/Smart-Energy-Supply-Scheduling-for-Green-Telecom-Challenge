Your model's performance metrics indicate that it is performing well:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.3388
This value suggests that, on average, the model's predictions are off by about 0.339 kWh from the actual values. For energy consumption predictions, this is relatively low, indicating good accuracy.

Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.3318
MSE penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller ones. A lower MSE is better, and your model's MSE is relatively low, which is a positive sign.

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.5760
RMSE is in the same unit as the target variable (kWh in this case). A lower RMSE means that the model's predictions are closer to the actual values. Your RMSE indicates a reasonably good prediction performance.

R-squared (R²) score: 0.9527
An R² score close to 1 indicates that a large proportion of the variance in the target variable is explained by the model. An R² of 0.9527 is excellent, suggesting that your model explains 95.27% of the variance in energy consumption.
